During an event that took place on May 3, 2017 in Buenos Aires, [German KÃ¼ber](https://twitter.com/germankuber) facilitated a presentation about API Management with [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), the API Platform developed and commercialized by Microsoft.

## About the event

The event took place at the [Avature](http://avature.net/) offices in Buenos Aires and counted with around 30 guests in place plus 15 watching the online streaming. The presentation contained a mix of theoretical explanation about the concepts to be managed, and the way of doing it by making use of the platform features.

People attended the event and committed themselves to proposing topics for future episodes. After that, we all enjoyed some snacks and drinks provided by the Venue, meanwhile multiple conversations were being held (philosophy and theology included!)
