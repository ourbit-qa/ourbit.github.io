With this (not that) recent desires of writing at ourBit again, I realized that the tools provided by *blogger by Google* were not good enough or didn't fulfill requirements that, in my opinion, should be provided by a *blogging* platform out of the box<!--MORE-->.  

After researching other tools that could help me with this task (*Wordpress, Joomla*, etc), I concluded that non of these would meet my expectations by one reason or another. Basically, I am biased to think that the main reason is that, even though these are good platforms, all of them are targeted to a user not specialized enogh for using another kind of tools.  

That's how I remembered having used *Jekyll and GitHub Pages* in the past, for building some static page, and so I started evaluating it as an alternative.  

***Jekyll*** **is definitively not providing better tools than the other platforms**. It doesn't count with a comments feature, it doesn't create a new blog in minutes with its corresponding archives, one-click-apply templates, etc. What ends up being a priority here is the **flexibility**, which turns *Jekyll* into a **candidate tool for developers** (or other professionals with IT knowledge enough) to becoming their tailored *blogging* "platform".  

The ramp up time was about 1 hour (nothing more). In my case, I already had some experience so it was just a matter of revisiting some concepts, looking for some configuration details and start rolling. Well, almost. Once I had everything working, I started to think about the design. I didn't want anything fancy but comfortable to read (and obviously, I wanted something that matches my personal tastes). Well, my design skills are close to null, hence, I decided to look for free *templates (or themes)* and adapt one of them. I ran into [CleanBlog](https://github.com/IronSummitMedia/startbootstrap-clean-blog) by [David Miller](https://github.com/davidtmiller) to whom I give thanks for publishing this material. Adapting and applying it to the already running blog was a matter of minutes.  

### Why am I choosing *Jekyll y GitHub Pages*?/¿Qué me hace elegir *Jekyll y GitHub Pages*?

- The possibility of counting with *Open Source* tools/La posibilidad de contar con herramientas *Open Source*.
- Ads-Free: This is free. No strings attached/Libre de publicidad: Esto es gratuito sin letra chica.
- Flexibility and Extensibility: I can build plugins and tools on top of the platform/Flexibilidad y Extensibilidad: Puedo desarrollar plugins y herramientas sobre la plataforma.
- Simplicity:Creating Posts is as simple as writing a text file and follow the GitHub worflow for publishing/Simpleza: Crear Posts es tan simple como escribir en un archivo de texto y seguir el flujo normal de GitHub para publicar.
- Capability of receiving *Pull Requests*: I;m interested on hacing readers suggesting fixes, or even heving them publishing on this blog. **I hope you send your Posts via Pull Requests**/Capacidad de Recibir *Pull Requests*: Me interesa que cualquier lector pueda sugerir correcciones, o incluso, publicar en este blog. **Espero Pull Requests con sus Posts**.
- *Markdown* Support: This might be a personal taste, but I find very simple and convenient to write in *Markdown* instead of dealing with *WYSIWYG* editors that end failing when attempting to go beyond their capabilities/Soporte a *Markdown*: Esto quizá es un gusto personal. Pero encuentro muy simple y conveniente escribir en *Markdown* en lugar de lidiar con editores *WYSIWYG* que terminan fallando cuando quiero ir más allá que las opciones soportadas.
- Code Highlight: Mandatory for a snippet containing blog/*Highlight* de código: Escencial para un Blog dónde haya snippets.  
{% highlight javascript %}
(function(msg) {
  alert(msg);
})("Bienvenidos al nuevo ourBit");
{% endhighlight %}

These are just a few reasons. You should find yours. I suggest you to invest 1 hour in learning how to use it (maybe it won't convince you as a *Blogging* tool, but it worth knowing how *Jekyll and GitHub Pages* works).
