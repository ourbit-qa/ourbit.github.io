<h2> About the writer</h2>
<p>I'm Norberto and I have spent the last 25 years (almost my entire life)
studying, researching and working on IT. It's much more than just a job to me.</p>
<p>Between my interests: APIs, IoT, Open Source, Leadership and Management.</p>
<p>When not IT(ing) I play guitar, cook, read and write.</p>
<br />
<h2> About ourBit</h2>
<p>It started as a way of collecting some random and newly aquired
knowledge documentation page (or at least that was the idea). But I like writing and
I can't help doing it. Combining that and the fact that no matter how advanced
or basic a knowkedge is, it could help anyone else, you have a blog.</p>
