## About the event

The event took place at the [Avature](http://avature.net/) offices in Buenos Aires and counted with around 50 guests in place plus 20 watching the online streaming. The presentation was shaped by a brief theoretical introduction, followed by a set of live demos covering the different aspects of the [GraphQL Spec](https://facebook.github.io/graphql/).

People were really engaged, asking tons of interesting questions about the language capabilities and some possibilities of applying it on their daily projects.
